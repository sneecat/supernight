# Supernight
Supernight is a series of wifi LED controllers with the following features:

- High current capability
- 10 bit dimming
- 25kHz+ PWM for flicker-free film operation
- Lo-Mode 2kHz PWM for higher contrast ratio
- Manual override controls
- ArtNet compatible (lumenair, etc.)

This is a work in progress and is currently in the second round of PCB design
for supernight2, the 2 channel (warm white / cold white) version. Single channel will be the same design with 2x current capability.
