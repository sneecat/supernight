# Supernight
Supernight is a series of wifi LED controllers with the following features:

- High current capability (8A per-channel)
- 10 bit dimming
- 25kHz+ PWM for flicker-free film operation
- Lo-Mode 1kHz PWM for higher contrast ratio
- Physical controls
- Manual override
- ArtNet compatible (lumenair, etc.)

This is a work in progress. Currently I am going into software development, to ensure that my PCB is sound before ordering.
